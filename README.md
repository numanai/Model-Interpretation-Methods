# ML-model-for-Medical-Treatment
In this project we will focus on the interpretation of machine learning and deep learning models.

In this project you'll use various methods to interpret different types of machine learning models. In particular, you'll learn about the following topics:

- Interpreting Deep Learning Models
    - Understanding output using GradCAMs
- Feature Importance in Machine Learning
    - Permutation Method
    - SHAP Values

Let's get started.You can read the notes for the theoretical background required for this project: [link](https://github.com/numanai/Model-Interpretation-Methods/blob/master/Interpret%20AI%20Models.pdf)
